XD\n\nThis COG stores a dictionary of strings in a separate file called \"designer_icons.json\".\nThis COG also requires the following libraries to work properly: `bs4, typing, datetime, dateutil, requests, rivercogutils, river_mwclient`.\nIt will also do a few GET requests to https://leagueoflegends.com and https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com to get all the data needed for parsing. To parse use `[p]pnparser parse all <patch_notes_version>` or type `[p]pnparser help` to see all available commands.",
