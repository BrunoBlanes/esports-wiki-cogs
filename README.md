## Setting up your Gamepedia bot password

You MUST MUST MUST do this IN DM WITH THE BOT!!!!!!!!!!

DO NOT SEND THIS INFORMATION IN A PUBLIC CHANNEL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


Send the following: ` !set api gamepedia account,RheingoldRiver bot,Nami password,sdfjklgsertgjselrgjsrtgh`

Replace `RheingoldRiver` with your account name, `Nami` with the name of your bot password, and that keyspam with your actual bot password.
| Account | Bot | Password |
--- | --- | ---
| Actual name of Gamepedia account | Name you give the password at Special:BotPasswords | Password that gets generated for you |

It's suggested to use a unique bot password for this that you don't also use for another purpose (e.g. AWB, etc.)
